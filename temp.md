# Project Background

## Context

Give any background or scene-setting required in order for the Problem, Impact of Problem, and Project Objectives sections to make sense. For example, it may be necessary to explain how a particular process services one of the University’s needs, or what activities a particular business unit within UAS carries out.

## Problem

Describe the problem. Because this is the End of Project report, it may be appropriate to describe both the original problem as it was when the project started, and how the problem evolved during the project. For example, the original problem for the Casual Payroll project didn’t feature compliance issues, though several significant ones were identified during the project.

## Impact of Problem

Describe the impact of the problem. As with the Problem section, the impact may have changed over the duration of the project.

## Project Objectives

What did the project set out to achieve? To what extent was it successful?

# People and their involvement

Describe the different stakeholder groups, and other parties involved. If appropriate and practical, describe the effort involved (e.g. number of practitioners, FTE, duration of project).

# Approach

Describe how the project was approached. Give reasons for this particular approach as appropriate.

# Benefits

Refer and provide links to existing benefit documentation, such as the Benefits Map and the Benefits realisation plan.

It may be necessary to include additional detail in this section: for example,

*   To explain how some of the benefits identified early in the project have been amended, or dropped
*   to describe which benefits have actually been delivered, and any quantification around them,
*   to describe which benefits have not yet been realised, the reasons why, and what plans there are to measure them in the future
*   to describe benefits that relate to progress in embedding a culture of Continuous Improvement and use of Lean tools. These benefits may be harder to quantify, but are one of the main purposes of the Focus programme.

# Deliverables

Describe the deliverables, including the original definitions of deliverables outlined in the project charter. Describe how they changed during the project, if they did. Describe how the deliverables provided a solution to the problem(s).

# Outstanding Actions

The project will normally have some kind of Action Plan, listing such things as actions, their expected due dates, and their owners. Since this is the End of Project report, most actions should have been either completed, or assigned to an owner external to the project. But it may be necessary to list some actions here, such as

1.  Actions owned by the Focus Programme (rather than the project). This might include measurement of benefits, or chasing of individuals/teams outside the Focus Programme who are in a position to measure them.
2.  Actions that need to be completed by external groups, in order to deliver a benefit that Focus wishes to measure, either on a one-off basis, or regularly. For example, for the Casual Payroll project, some of the benefits will arise once IT Services complete their project to implement the Time and Absence management module of CoreHR, which includes a timesheet capability.

# Sustain and Continuous Improvement Activities

The project will normally have one or more documents arising from the Sustain and Continuous Improvement Phases (e.g. CI Plan, Maturity Assessment). Since this is the end of project report, most of the activities described within these other documents should be agreed, with the appropriate team member taking ownership, and implementing activities as necessary. It may be necessary to provide a short summary here.

# Recommendations

Note that the main different between an action and a recommendation is that an Action should have an agreed owner. In contrast, a recommendation should have an audience, to which the recommendation should be communicated.

# Outcomes/Impacts

This is the ‘so what’ section. What difference(s) did the project make.

# Testimonials

Include user feedback, including names, and state whether the user is happy for their quote to be used elsewhere.

# Lessons Learned

Any lessons learned.

It is important that the End of Project Report is as factual and open as possible. Set against that, there may be situations (e.g. with respect to Lessons Learned connected with key stakeholders) where the need to be factual and open has to be balanced against the management of existing relationships. In such cases, it may be necessary to have a separate ‘Internal Lessons Learned’ document, which would have a more limited circulation than the current document. Typically, it would be circulated only within the Focus Programme.

# Next Steps

For example, future projects already identified or agreed.
